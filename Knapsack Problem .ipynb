You’d like to take all of them but your knapsack can only carry P pounds. Suppose you can either take an object or not. Your goal is to maximize your utility without exceeding the weight limit of your bag**."

    "1. Creating the variable: We will represent our choice mathematically with a vector of 1’s and 0’s. A 1 will mean we’ve selected that object and a 0 will mean we’ve left it home. We construct a variable that can only take 1’s and 0’s with the cvxpy.Variable object.\n",
    "2. Specifying the constraints: We only need to make sure that the sum of our objects doesn’t exceed the weight limit P. We can compute the total weight of our objects with the dot product of the selection vector and the weights vector. Note that cvxpy overloads the * operator to perform matrix multiplication.\n",
    "3. Formulating the objective function: We want to find the selection that maximizes our utility. The utility of any given selection is the dot product of the selection vector and the utility vector.\n"
